# Space Buns Web Assignment

	We sell burger that are out of the world


**1.0 Description of the Organization**

	Space Buns is a consumer-centric burger business that focuses on making the best handmade burgers in the world.


Inspired by the infamous “Burger Ramly '' which is loved by every true Malaysian, we decided to make a classy version of it. So, we started with a simple concept of selling affordable and delicious burgers paired with the best ingredients on top of our freshly handmade bun. We hope to provide a mind blowing experience to all the customers like how the Space blows everyone’s mind.


Started in 2020 from a roadside “Ramly Burger” stall in the Damansara neighbourhood with a homemade burger menu, the company has since undergone an expansion of branches that is now available in Petaling Jaya, Cheras, Kepong, Sungai Buloh, Bukit Bintang, Klang, and Setapak. We provide the options for you to dine-in, takeaway or even delivery via GrabFood and FoodPanda. But most importantly, we can guarantee that by ordering your burgers through our website at https://spacebuns.web.app/, it will for sure bring you the best ordering experience like never before. We promise.


We are here as one to make an impact on the world. Some people build the world’s tallest building or create the world’s fastest cars. What about us? We’re out to make the best burgers that satisfy your taste buds and stomach. At the very core, Space Buns is a community business. It is made up of everyday people like you and me. As we continue to grow with your support, we promise to strive harder to give back to the community.
Our goal is to achieve 100 stores nationwide by 2025. We believe that with persistence and perseverance, also with our mouth-watering burgers, we will be able to achieve this goal and might even be possible to be one of Malaysia's largest burger outlets out there.
